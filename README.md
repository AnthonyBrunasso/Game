# Game

To run this project you will need to clone and build the lib from:

https://github.com/AnthonyBrunasso/4xSimulation

The lib created from that project should go in the root directory of this project. The necessary headers are currently versioned in this project.

You will also need to either clone and build, or download the libs for SFML and place them in a lib folder at the root of this project. 

See: http://www.sfml-dev.org/ for information on that.
